# App-Sus

App-Sus is a collection of three mini-applications built with React. These applications provide the functionality of book management, an email client, and a note-taking app. The project focuses on delivering pixel-perfect style and design, mimicking the look and feel of popular applications such as Google Books, Gmail, and Google Keep.
